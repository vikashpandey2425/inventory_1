In this project we design a 64 bit ALU with 32 select line operations that can be performed by it in VHDL using VHDL software XILINX. We will also check our designs behavior using MODELSIM PE 5.7 F and by designing its Testbench code in XILINX. We have designed our ALU to perform 32 operations which are arithmetic, logical, comparative, and shifting and many mixed types of them. There are many ways of designing an ALU in VHDL. We have used Behavioral type of modeling in our design. We know that ALU is the core for the microprocessor since it handles its ability to perform any type of mathematical or shifting operation. Here we will take two 64 bit inputs, one 5 bit select line (i.e. 32 operations), a carry output and a 64 bit output line.
We analyze our 64 Bit ALU with 32 operations here using MODELSIM in which we assign clock inputs to our input lines and check for the desired output in the output and carry lines. We will also design a test bench for the assigned code and check its response.
